# ASD-problems
Excercises from Algorithms and Data Structures course at MIMUW. Problem solutions include: Dijkstra's algorithm, lexicographical sorting and interval tree algorithms. Problem can be found at: https://szkopul.edu.pl/c/laboratorium-z-asd-20172018/p/

* tan (Budget airlines problem)
Professor Makary is flying to the conference in a Faraway City (FC). Professor's favourite airlines offer a discount for 
flights between certain cities, in exchange for special coupons. Each coupon can only be used once, 
on one stretch of a road connecting two cities. The discount is defined for every stretch by the airlines.
Professor has several such coupons and would like to get to the conference for the lowest possible price. Help him writing a program.

* kap (Captain's problem)
Captain Bytazzar is crossing the Byton Sea. There are n islands on the sea, numbered from 1 to n. 
Captain has berthed by the 1st island and he plans to to get to the n-th island.
During the cruise his ship always moves in one of four directions: north, south, west or east.
In every moment the captain or the first officer stands at the wheel. 
Every time the ship makes a 90 degree turn, the captain and the officer switch places.
During the cruise the ship can stop by other islands. After each stop captain can decide, whether he wants to stand at the wheel first.
In other words: on every stretch from one island to another one of the sailors steers west or east, and the other north or south. 
Captain is thinking now how to plan the cruise, so he would spend as little time as possible at the wheel.
He doesn't care how long would take the whole travel. Let's assume that ship travels with constant speed of one unit per hour. 

*par (Bit Park problem)
In a Bit Park there are n clearings numbered from 1 to n. Some pairs of clearings are connected by two-way paths.
As it is a Bit Park, the system of paths creates a Binary Tree with a root in the 1st clearing.
Byteck and Byteen came to park after school. Children decided to play a game: alternately each child chooses a number A of a clearing
and a non-negative integer D. The other child has to find a clearing in a distance of D from the clearing A.
If such clearing doesn't exist, the child has to say it. Byteck would like to make a game easier for him and 
ask you to write a program that would find clearings for the numbers given by Byteen.
